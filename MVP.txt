Heco Portal – MVP Document Reading Guide (for Developers)
This document describes the functional and operational logic of the Heco Portal MVP.
It is intentionally detailed and structured by user roles and workflows.
This short guide explains how to navigate the document and where to focus first.
________________


1. What the Platform Is (Big Picture)
The Heco Portal MVP is built around three core layers:
1. Traveller-facing homepage powered by AI

2. Heco Core Team (HCT) dashboard

3. Trip Manager (operational core)

All traveller interactions ultimately feed into HCT-controlled workflows.
________________


2. Platform Users (Who Does What)
The document explains the following user types:
   * Travellers
 → explore, build trips, interact with AI

   * Heco Core Team (HCT)
 → supervises AI, validates trips, tracks payments, manages providers and content

   * Service Providers (SPs)
 → HRPs, HLHs, and OSPs, who deliver trips on the ground

If you want to understand roles and permissions, start with:
      * Sections 3–4 (Core concepts & users)

________________


3. Traveller Entry & Homepage (AI Layer)
The homepage is the main traveller interface and is AI-powered.
Key elements:
         * Landing page (intent detection)

         * Homepage tabs:

            * Discover

            * Your Journey (trip planner)

            * Impact

Travellers:
               * never enter full trip details upfront

               * interact through signals, not rigid forms

               * can always ask the AI to adjust their trip

If you want to understand AI behaviour and traveller UX, read:
                  * Sections 5–7

                  * Especially Your Journey (Selected Experiences, Timeline Itinerary)

________________


4. How Traveller Data Is Used
Everything collected on the homepage:
                     * preferences

                     * itinerary drafts

                     * questions

                     * support requests

is later:
                        * visible

                        * editable

                        * validated

by the Heco Core Team.
Nothing is finalized without human oversight in the MVP.
________________


5. HCT Dashboard (Operational Control)
The HCT Dashboard is where the platform becomes operational.
It includes:
                           * Admin tab (system configuration)

                           * Control Panel (AI supervision & traveller support)

                           * Leads

                           * Trips

                           * Calendar

                           * Payments

                           * Providers

                           * Travelers

                           * Provider Applications

If you want to understand how humans control the system, go directly to:
                              * Section 12 – HCT Dashboard

________________


6. Trip Manager (Most Important Section)
The Trip Manager is the single source of truth for trips.
It is where HCT:
                                 * reviews itineraries

                                 * edits services

                                 * tracks payments

                                 * confirms trips

                                 * manages operational reality

If you read only one section in depth, read:
                                    * Trip Manager sections

Everything else ultimately connects to it.
________________


7. Content & Provider Management
The document also explains:
                                       * Experience management

                                       * Regenerative Project management

                                       * Service Provider applications and approval

These sections are useful for:
                                          * understanding data models

                                          * knowing what content is dynamic vs static

Relevant sections:
                                             * 15 – Experience Management

                                             * 16 – Regenerative Project Management

                                             * 17 – SP Application Page

9. Key MVP Principles to Keep in Mind
                                                   * MVP is human-governed

                                                   * AI assists, it does not decide alone

                                                   * Payments happen outside the platform

                                                   * Flexibility is preferred over automation

                                                   * Phase 2 is intentionally out of scope


MVP
1. Purpose, Scope, and Nature of This Document
1.1 Purpose
This document describes the functional logic, user flows, and operational behaviour of the Heco Portal MVP.
It is written to:
                                                      * Provide a shared understanding between product owner (Heco) and developers

                                                      * Explain how the system is expected to behave, not how it must be coded

                                                      * Serve as a reference narrative during development and iteration

This document intentionally focuses on:
                                                         * User journeys

                                                         * System reactions

                                                         * Data responsibilities

                                                         * Human–AI collaboration

1.2 What This Document Is Not
This document is not:
                                                            * A frozen UI design

                                                            * A final UX specification

                                                            * A database schema

                                                            * A technical architecture document

UI, UX, and technical implementation choices are open to discussion and iteration, as long as they respect the logic and flows described here.

1.3 MVP vs Long-Term Vision
From the beginning, the Heco Portal is designed as a scalable system, but development is consciously split into phases.
                                                               * MVP

                                                                  * Prioritizes usability, operational feasibility, and learning

                                                                  * Accepts manual steps where automation is not yet viable

                                                                  * Relies on the Heco Core Team (HCT) as a bridge between AI and reality

                                                                     * Phase 2 (Fully-fledged system)

                                                                        * Introduces deeper automation

                                                                        * Enables direct AI ↔ service provider communication

                                                                        * Reduces manual workload for the HCT

                                                                        * Supports national and international scaling

Throughout this document, features or behaviours that belong to Phase 2 only are explicitly mentioned as such.

2. Core Product Vision (User-Centric)
2.1 Who the Platform Is For
The Heco Portal is designed for travellers who:
                                                                           * Are interested in less crowded, authentic, place-based experiences

                                                                           * Are curious but may lack local knowledge

                                                                           * Value meaningful travel, human connection, and ecological impact

They are not necessarily expert travellers, but they are:
                                                                              * Open to discovery

                                                                              * Willing to trust guidance

                                                                              * Interested in understanding why a trip is designed in a certain way

________________


2.2 Two Dominant Traveller Behaviours
The platform must support two distinct but overlapping behaviours, without forcing the user into one mode.
A. AI-led travellers
These users:
                                                                                 * Want the system to propose a coherent itinerary quickly

                                                                                 * Prefer answering questions rather than browsing extensively

                                                                                 * Expect the AI to “take responsibility” for the structure of the trip

For them, the AI behaves like:
A travel designer that asks the right questions and proposes solutions.
________________


B. Explorative travellers
These users:
                                                                                    * Enjoy browsing regions and experiences

                                                                                    * Want to understand options before committing

                                                                                    * Prefer incremental decisions

For them, the AI behaves like:
A guide that stays in the background and supports exploration.
________________


2.3 Design Consequence
The platform must:
                                                                                       * Allow seamless switching between exploration and AI guidance

                                                                                       * Never lock the user into a single mode

                                                                                       * Treat both behaviours as valid and equal

This duality directly influences:
                                                                                          * Landing page logic

                                                                                          * Homepage behaviour

                                                                                          * Chatbot behaviour

                                                                                          * Itinerary construction

3. User Types, Roles, and Access Logic (MVP)
3.1 Overview of User Types
The platform supports multiple user types from the MVP stage onward, primarily to:
                                                                                             * Populate real operational data

                                                                                             * Test end-to-end flows

                                                                                             * Avoid building a “traveller-only” system disconnected from reality

User types:
                                                                                                1. Travellers

                                                                                                2. Heco Core Team (HCT)

                                                                                                   * Admin

                                                                                                   * Collaborator

                                                                                                      3. Heco Regional Partners (HRP)

                                                                                                      4. Heco Local Hosts (HLH)

                                                                                                      5. Other Service Providers (OSP)

                                                                                                      6. Local Associations (LAs) in Phase 2 only

Each user type:
                                                                                                         * Has a unique user ID

                                                                                                         * Is associated with a role

                                                                                                         * Has access to a role-based dashboard

3.2 Travellers
Travellers:
                                                                                                            * Design trips

                                                                                                            * Interact with the AI

                                                                                                            * Make payments

                                                                                                            * Generate impact through their trips

A traveller may have:
                                                                                                               * Zero, one, or multiple trips

                                                                                                               * Trips in different statuses (Not confirmed / Confirmed / Running / Completed / Cancelled)

They:
                                                                                                                  * Supervise AI-generated itineraries

                                                                                                                  * Intervene when data is missing

                                                                                                                  * Manage trips, payments, and SPs

HCT roles:
                                                                                                                     * Admin: system configuration and governance

                                                                                                                     * Collaborator: full operational access without system-level configuration rights

The HCT is intentionally present in the MVP as a human stabilizer of the system.

3.4 HRPs, HLHs, and OSPs (all referred as SPs)
These users represent local service providers, with different scopes:
                                                                                                                        * HRP (Heco Regional Partner): regional coordination, oversight, and ownership

                                                                                                                        * HLH (Heco Local Host): provide experiences and local hosting

                                                                                                                        * OSP (Other Service Provider): transport, activities, guides, or other services

From the MVP:
                                                                                                                           * They can register and be approved

                                                                                                                           * Their data (entered by the HCT in the MVP) feeds the trip and pricing logic

                                                                                                                           * They are linked to trips, regions, and payments

Direct AI ↔ provider communication belongs to Phase 2, not the MVP.

3.5 User Identity and Data Relationships
At a conceptual level:
                                                                                                                              * A traveller is linked to trips

                                                                                                                              * Trips are linked to experiences

                                                                                                                              * Experiences are linked to regions and providers

                                                                                                                              * Providers are linked to payments

                                                                                                                              * Trips generate financial and impact data

These relationships are fundamental and must be preserved across all phases.

4. Core AI & Algorithm Logic (Conceptual)
This section explains how the system reasons, independently of UI.
4.1 Experiences as Building Blocks
An experience is the smallest curated unit of travel.
In the MVP:
                                                                                                                                 * Experiences are created and maintained by the HCT

                                                                                                                                 * The AI does not create experiences with the HLH (this will be for the phase 2)

                                                                                                                                 * Experiences are reusable across multiple trips

Each experience includes:
                                                                                                                                    * A region

                                                                                                                                    * One or more activities (optional when the experience is a stay)

                                                                                                                                    * A defined duration (number of days / hours, start time, end time)

                                                                                                                                    * Included services (stay, guide, transport)

                                                                                                                                    * Constraints:

                                                                                                                                       * Seasonality

                                                                                                                                       * Difficulty

                                                                                                                                       * Minimum / maximum number of participants

                                                                                                                                       * Age or physical restrictions

                                                                                                                                          * An itinerary when relevant (like for a trek)

                                                                                                                                          * A base cost structure
Note: 
                                                                                                                                             * Experiences can last several days, but their duration can also be as short as one hour.

                                                                                                                                             * The duration and time restriction of an experience is a crucial data for the AI, the traveler or HCT user to build itineraries without conflict during operations

Experiences are structurally stable, even if details evolve.

4.2 Trip as a Dynamic Composition
A trip is a dynamic composition of:
                                                                                                                                                * Experiences

                                                                                                                                                * Connecting services (transport, accommodation, meals, guides)

                                                                                                                                                * Traveller preferences

                                                                                                                                                * Dates and group size

The AI’s role is to:
                                                                                                                                                   * Organize selected experiences logically

                                                                                                                                                   * Fill the gaps between them

                                                                                                                                                   * Ensure feasibility and coherence

The user (traveller or HCT) always retains the ability to modify the result.

4.3 Chronology and Feasibility Logic
When experiences are added to a trip, the AI evaluates:
                                                                                                                                                      * Order and chronology

                                                                                                                                                      * Travel distances

                                                                                                                                                      * End time of experience A

                                                                                                                                                      * Start time of experience B

If direct travel is not feasible, the AI:
                                                                                                                                                         * Adds intermediate stays

                                                                                                                                                         * Suggests optional activities

                                                                                                                                                         * Or leaves time intentionally free

The same logic applies:
                                                                                                                                                            * Before the first experience

                                                                                                                                                            * Between experiences

                                                                                                                                                            * After the last experience

4.4 Pricing Logic
Pricing is incremental and transparent.
It is composed of:
                                                                                                                                                               * Fixed experience costs

                                                                                                                                                               * Variable service costs:

                                                                                                                                                                  * Transport (by distance and vehicle type)

                                                                                                                                                                  * Guides

4.5 AI Limitations and Human Intervention (MVP)
In the MVP:
                                                                                                                                                                        * The AI may encounter missing or uncertain data

                                                                                                                                                                        * The AI explicitly identifies what it cannot resolve

                                                                                                                                                                        * The AI requests human input via the HCT Control Panel

The HCT then:
                                                                                                                                                                           * Collects the missing data manually

                                                                                                                                                                           * Feeds it back into the system

                                                                                                                                                                           * Allows the AI to continue its work with the traveler
This behaviour is intentional and prepares the system for Phase 2 automation.
5. Traveller Entry & Orientation Flow
5.1 Sign-up / Log-in Logic
General Principle
During the MVP phase, access to the platform is restricted to signed-in users.
This ensures that:
                                                                                                                                                                              * trips can be saved automatically,

                                                                                                                                                                              * traveller actions can be linked to a unique user,

                                                                                                                                                                              * support and follow-up remain consistent.

Sign-up Process
During sign-up, the user is asked to provide:
                                                                                                                                                                                       * Name

                                                                                                                                                                                       * Email address

                                                                                                                                                                                       * Create their password

Trip Persistence and User Linking
Once signed in:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * any trip the user starts building is automatically saved

                                                                                                                                                                                             * the trip is linked to the corresponding traveller account

This allows travellers to:
                                                                                                                                                                                                * leave the platform at any time

                                                                                                                                                                                                * resume trip building later from their account

Post-Login Behaviour
After successful log-in or sign-up:
                                                                                                                                                                                                   * the traveller is redirected to the landing page

                                                                                                                                                                                                   * from where they can start or continue building their trip

________________


5.2 Landing Page – Intent Detection
The Landing Page is the traveller’s first interaction point after log-in.
It functions as an entry filter, not as a marketing-heavy page.
Its role is to:
                                                                                                                                                                                                      * capture high-level intent

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * reduce friction

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * adapt the behaviour of the homepage and AI

The landing page does not attempt to collect complete trip details.
________________


Resume Previous Trip (When Applicable)
If the traveller has at least one saved trip:
                                                                                                                                                                                                         * the landing page displays a clear invitation to resume their most recent trip

                                                                                                                                                                                                         * the invitation allows the traveller to:

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * resume trip building immediately, or

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * ignore it and start a new exploration

If no saved trip exists:
                                                                                                                                                                                                               * the landing page behaves as a standard first-entry experience

This mechanism ensures continuity without forcing the traveller into a predefined path.

Content and Structure
At the top of the column, the Trip ID is displayed, followed by a “Save this trip” button.
The trip is automatically saved at all times.
The purpose of the “Save this trip” button is to allow the traveller to assign a name to the trip.
Once a name is assigned:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * the trip name is displayed at the top of the column

7.4 Your Impact (Tab 3)
Purpose
This tab makes impact visible while designing the trip, not after.


7.4.1 Impact Logic
General Principle
The Impact section translates the financial contribution of a trip into concrete, place-based regenerative outcomes.
Impact is always:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * region-linked

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * A corresponding Regenerative Project (RP) card is displayed.

If a trip spans multiple regions:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Multiple RP cards are shown, one per region.

Each RP card represents the regenerative project through which the trip’s impact is realized.

8. Service Providers (SPs): HRPs, HLHs, and OSPs
8.1 Purpose
Service providers (SPs) are the execution layer of the portal. Their data (filled in by HCT in the MVP) must support:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Experience definition (what is possible and when)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Trip feasibility (availability, distance, constraints)

B. Traveller Support & Communication Hub
Purpose
This section centralizes all support requests initiated by travellers via the “Request support” button on the traveller-side portal. 
Note: Traveller support is available only to logged-in users. If a traveller clicks the “Request support” button while not logged in, a log-in / sign-up pop-up is displayed before the request can be submitted.
It is the primary interface for human intervention in the traveller journey during the MVP.

Purpose
This section handles situations where the AI cannot proceed autonomously due to missing, uncertain, or conflicting data.
When blocked, the AI must:

Immerse yourself in one of Ladakh’s most remote and authentic cultural landscapes with this 2-night village experience in Tar Village. Tucked deep in the rugged valleys of the Sham region along the Indus River, Tar is a settlement that has preserved its traditional way of life precisely because it remains largely inaccessible by road. The journey itself — a scenic hike through a narrow mountain gorge — sets the tone for what lies ahead: a genuine connection with people, landscape, and tradition that few travellers encounter.


This experience invites you to live as the villagers live — staying in traditional homes, sharing meals, and participating in daily rhythms shaped by ancient agricultural practices in a high-altitude desert environment. With only a handful of families residing year-round, Tar’s community has maintained deep cultural roots, vibrant local traditions, and a remarkable hospitality born of centuries of mountain life. Here, modernity has limited influence, and every interaction carries a sense of genuine human warmth amid breathtaking natural beauty.


Your days in Tar begin with the slow dawn over towering arid peaks, where the first light reveals fields of barley and apricots, and the silence is broken only by birdsong and the distant murmur of the river. As you explore the village lanes, meet elders and hosts who welcome you into their homes, you’ll discover a way of life grounded in self-sufficiency, mutual support, and respect for the fragile mountain environment. Simple moments become memorable — sharing Ladakhi butter tea, helping gather produce during planting or harvest seasons, or listening to stories beside a traditional hearth.

This experience is more than a stay — it’s an invitation to slow down, to walk where cars cannot reach, and to witness life shaped by nature and centuries-old traditions. By staying in Tar Village, you not only uncover authentic Ladakhi culture, but you also support a community that has worked to preserve its way of life responsibly, sustainably, and thoughtfully in the face of change.

Beyond cultural immersion, the area offers spectacular landscapes and trekking opportunities. The path to Tar traces a dramatic gorge before opening into a green oasis against a backdrop of rugged mountain walls. Treks to nearby passes or along ancient routes echo with views that shift from barren slopes to unexpected pockets of greenery. Local guides can lead you through these trails, giving context to the plants, terrain, and history that define this extraordinary corner of the Himalayas.
